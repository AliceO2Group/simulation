The following list provides an overview to other pertinent resources and platforms for information exchange about simulation topics:


## Contact

The following channels are used to discuss about simulation topics

* [Mattermost O2DPG channel](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/alice/channels/o2dpg) - discuss the O2DPG MC production system

* [Mattermost Run3 Simulation channel](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/alice/channels/o2-simulation) - discuss questions about ALICE simulation in general

* [ALICE Talk](https://alice-talk.web.cern.ch/) - Discussion forum in Discourse style


## Meetings

Detector simulation meetings are held in form of the "WP12 / WP13 meetings" in this [indico category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/4868/). Announcements are sent to the `alice-o2-wp12` CERN E-group. Meetings typically take place Wednesday afternoon (3pm) every 2 or 3 weeks.

There is also a dedicated [meeting category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/12828/) for ALICE3 related simulation discussions.

## JIRA bug tracking

Bug reports or feature requests are followed up with tickets in our [JIRA system](https://alice.its.cern.ch/jira/projects/O2) (With simulation as component). Opening tickets is preferred over private email contact.
